# react-routing
A collection of experiments in react routing v4

Based off of the https://github.com/js-jslog/react-sandbox repo

## Usage
- `npm start` will start a webpack-dev-server serving index.html (including bundle.js) at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- `npm run build` will bundle the entry point of src/frontend/app/public/index.jsx into src/frontend/public/js/bundle.js (not required *and* not performed for running `npm start`)
- `npm run watch` will bundle whenever a change is seen in index.jsx or any of it's imports
